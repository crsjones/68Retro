#### SS50 and SS30 Bus

The SS-50 and SS-30 busses have been changed to reduce the size and make them more suitable for prototyping with breadboard and Dupont cables.

1. Connector pitch changed to 0.1" from 0.156".

2. Change power supply requirement to 5V only.
3. Remove the Baud Rate Generator from the Bus.
4. Changed  non-inverting Data Bus Buffers.
   

The connector is the Molex 22-15-2106, I purchase them from Mouser (538-22-15-2106).
0.1" pin header and female receptacles are a cheaper option but not recommended for more than a few insertion cycles.
