### FLEX 2 Image

This is a FLEX 2 SSSD Boot Disk image.
Copy it to any Sandisk CF card with a program like 'Win32DiskImager'

It is a 35 track 10 sector image, each track and sector is mapped to the CF card using LBA addressing. Flex uses 256 byte sectors so the disk driver does not read or write the top 256 bytes of the CF card 512 byte sectors.

The image includes Mike Douglas' pcget and pcput utilities to transfer files to and from the disk.
